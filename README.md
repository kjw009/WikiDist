## Improvements I wanted to do but didn't have time
Switching between revisions couldv'e been done by creating the revision components inside the latest document component and then using routing (react-router-dom) to switch between the revisions. I would've done it this way but I didn't have time.

For the post API , I would have created a form component that is able use the inputted JSON to convert into a react component for render. The component will then use routing (react-router-dom) to switch between the components

## How to test
run run.sh first then and then in another terminal , change to the ui directory and type in the command , npm start. Use localhost:3000 to view and interact with the frontend.
